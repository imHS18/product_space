# AI Agent Architecture: Customer Sentiment Watchdog

## Multi-Agent System Design for AI Hackathon

### System Overview

The Customer Sentiment Watchdog is designed as an **autonomous multi-agent system** where specialized AI agents collaborate to monitor, analyze, and respond to customer sentiment in real-time. Unlike traditional applications, this system features agents with distinct personalities, goals, and decision-making capabilities.

### Core Architecture Principles

1. **Agent Specialization**: Each agent has a specific role and expertise area
2. **Autonomous Decision Making**: Agents make independent decisions within their domain
3. **Collaborative Intelligence**: Agents communicate and coordinate through shared context
4. **Emergent Behavior**: The system exhibits intelligent behavior beyond individual agent capabilities
